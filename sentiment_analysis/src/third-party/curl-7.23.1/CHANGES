- progress_cb: avoid buffer overflow
  
  The progress bar output function would blindly use the terminal width
  without bounds checking. When using a very wide terminal that caused a
  buffer overflow and segfault.
  
  We now limit the max bar with to 255 columns, and I simplified the code
  to avoid an extra snprintf and buffer.

- ftp PORT: don't hang if bind() fails
  
  When the user requests PORT with a specific port or port range, the code
  could lock up in an endless loop. There's now an extra conditional that
  makes sure to special treat the error and try the local address only
  once so a second failure will abort the loop correctly.

- pingpong: change two comments wrongly referring "FTP"
  
  Just a sign of where the code originally was ripped out from. Now it is
  generic "pingpong".

- test 590: verify the bug fix in 4851dafcf1
  
  This test is created to verify Rene Bernhardt's patch which makes sure
  libcurl properly _not_ deals with Negotiate if not asked to even if the
  proxy says it can serve it.

- [Rene Bernhardt brought this change]

  HTTP auth: fix proxy Negotiate bug
  
  If a proxy offers several Authentication schemes where NTLM and
  Negotiate are offered by the proxy and you tell libcurl not to use the
  Negotiate scheme then the request never returns when the proxy answers
  with its HTTP 407 reply.
  
  It is reproducible by the following steps:
  
  - Use a proxy that offers NTLM and Negotiate ( CURLOPT_PROXY and
  CURLOPT_PROXYPORT )
  
  - Tell libcurl NOT to use Negotiate CURL_EASY_SETOPT(CURLOPT_PROXYAUTH,
  CURLAUTH_BASIC | CURLAUTH_DIGEST | CURLAUTH_NTLM )
  
  - Start the request
  
  The call to CURL_EASY_PERFORM never returns. If you switch on debug
  logging you can see that libcurl issues a new request As soon as it
  received the 407 reply. Instead it should return and set the response
  code to 407.

- ssluse.c: fix calling of OpenSSL's ERR_remove_state(0)
  
  Move calling of ERR_remove_state(0) a.k.a ERR_remove_thread_state(NULL)
  from Curl_ossl_close_all() to Curl_ossl_cleanup().
  
  In this way ERR_remove_state(0) is now only called in libcurl by
  curl_global_cleanup(). Previously it would get called by functions
  curl_easy_cleanup(), curl_multi_cleanup and potentially each time a
  connection was removed from a connection cache leading to premature
  destruction of OpenSSL's thread local state hash.
  
  Multi-threaded apps using OpenSSL enabled libcurl should still call
  function ERR_remove_state(0) or ERR_remove_thread_state(NULL) at the
  very end end of threads that do not call curl_global_cleanup().

- rename ftp_ssl: the struct field is used for many protocols
  
  Now called 'use_ssl' instead, which better matches the current CURLOPT
  name and since the option is used for all pingpong protocols (at least)
  it makes sense to not use 'ftp' in the name.

- FTP test server: fix server unresponsiveness
  
  Some torture tests left FTP test server in an unresponsive state, resulting

  ftpserver.pl logging relative to data channel establishment and tear down.
  Pending NODATACONN relative adjustments reserved for a further commit.

- runtests.pl: running server checks - commit 4464583a follow-up

- lib589.c: add CURLOPT_READDATA missing stuff

- ftpserver.pl: three new custom FTP server commands to disable data channel
  
  NODATACONN421: applies only to active FTP mode, instructs server to not
  establish data connection back to client and reply with FTP 421.
  
  NODATACONN425: applies only to active FTP mode, instructs server to not
  establish data connection back to client and reply with FTP 425.
  
  NODATACONN: applies to both active and passive FTP modes, instructs server
  to not establish nor accept a data channel and fool client into believing
  that the data channel connection is possible.
  
  Some polishing probably required.

- multi.c: OOM handling fix
  
  Fix curl_multi_cleanup() segfault when using weird cleanup sequence.

Daniel Stenberg (27 Oct 2011)
- multi: start ftp state machine when switching to DO_MORE
  
  This extends the fix from commit d7934b8bd491
  
  When the multi state is changed within the multi_runsingle from DOING to
  DO_MORE, we didn't immediately start the FTP state machine again. That
  then left the FTP state in FTP_STOP. When curl_multi_fdset() was
  subsequently called, the ftp_domore_getsock() function would return the
  wrong fd info.

- dist: add test 587
  
  I created test 587 in commit 840eff44f2b but forgot to add the file to
  the tarball. Added now.

- test 588: verify active FTP with multi interface without EPRT
  
  This is using the verbatim 525 test code but it disables EPRT in the
  server and this should work just as well anyway.

- FTP server: allow EPRT by default
  
  EPRT is now supported by default by the server. To disable it, use the
  generic REPLY instruction in the <servercmd> tag. Test 116 now has it
  disabled. All other existing active FTP port tests strip out the port
  commands from the logs already so the change of the server isn't that
  noticable.

- large headers: have curl accept >16K headers
  
  As commit 5850cc4808ab clarifies, libcurl can deliver header lines that
  are longer than CURL_MAX_WRITE_SIZE, only body data is limited to that
  size. The curl tool has check (when built debug-enabled) that made the
  wrong checks and this new test 1205 verifies that larger headers work.

- tool_operate.c: OOM handling fix

Daniel Stenberg (21 Oct 2011)
- curl_multi_fdset: correct fdset with FTP PORT use
  
  After a PORT has been issued, and the multi handle would switch to the
  CURLM_STATE_DO_MORE state (which is unique for FTP), libcurl would
  return the wrong fdset to wait for when curl_multi_fdset() is
  called. The code would blindly assume that it was waiting for a connect
  of the second connection, while that isn't true immediately after the
  PORT command.
  
  Also, the function multi.c:domore_getsock() was highly FTP-centric and
  therefore ugly to keep in protocol-agnostic code. I solved this problem
  by introducing a new function pointer in the Curl_handler struct called
  domore_getsock() which is only called during the DOMORE state for
  protocols that set that pointer.
  
  The new ftp.c:ftp_domore_getsock() function now returns fdset info about
  the control connection's command/response handling while such a state is
  in use, and goes over to waiting for a writable second connection first
  once the commands are done.
  
  The original problem could be seen by running test 525 and checking the
  time stamps in the FTP server log. I can verify that this fix at least
  fixes this problem.

  unnecessary system calls and the gnutls_transport_set_lowat function has
  been totally removed in >=gnutls-3 which causes build failures.

  When, for a given test, server is instructed to close connection after

  smtp: Added support for NTLM authentication
  
  Modified smtp_endofresp() to detect NTLM from the server specified list
  of supported authentication mechanisms.
  
  Modified smtp_authenticate() to start the sending of the NTLM data.
  
  Added smtp_auth_ntlm_type1_message() which creates a NTLM type-1
  message. This function is used by authenticate() to start the sending
  of data and by smtp_state_auth_ntlm_resp() when the AUTH command
  doesn't contain the type-1 message as part of the initial response.
  This lack of initial response can happen if an OOM error occurs or the
  type-1 message is longer than 504 characters. As the main AUTH command
  is limited to 512 character the data has to be transmitted in two
  parts; one containing the AUTH NTLM and the second containing the
  type-1 message.
  
  Added smtp_state_auth_ntlm_type2msg_resp() which handles the incoming
  type-2 message and sends an outgoing type-3 message. This type-2
  message is sent by the server in response to our type-1 message.
  
  Modified smtp_state_auth_resp() to handle the response to: the AUTH
  NTLM without the initial response and the type-2 response.
  
  Modified smtp_disconnect() to cleanup the NTLM SSPI stack.

  smtp: General tidy up ready for adding NTLM support
  
  Changed the name of variable l, in several functions, which represents

  Reworked smtp_authenticate() to be simpler and easier to follow.
  Variables and now initialised in their definitions and if no username
  and password are specified the function sets the state to SMTP_STOP and
  returns immediately, rather than being part of a huge if statement.

- curl_easy_setopt: Added scp and sftp to the URL section

Daniel Stenberg (28 Sep 2011)
- [Steve Holme brought this change]

  curl_easy_setopt: A brief tidy up
  
  Slight rewording of the CURLOPT_URL SMTP sub-section.
  
  Corrected the incorrect use of hyphens on the three uses of
  "zero-terminated" with "zero terminated" to match the rest of the
  document.
  
  Corrected the use of an out of place hyphen in CURLOPT_NOPROXY section.

- configure openssl version check: handle lack of L suffix
  
  It seems some versions of the OpenSSL version defines don't come with L
  appended to the number, so let's deal with that nicely.

- [Alejandro Alvarez brought this change]

  SSL session sharing support added
  
  With locking, plus test, plus documentation

Yang Tse (28 Sep 2011)
- curl tool: adjust header callback single call write limit warning
  
  Maximum amount of data a header callback is supposed to get in
  a single call from libcurl is limited by the lowest value of
  CURL_MAX_WRITE_SIZE and CURL_MAX_HTTP_HEADER.

Daniel Stenberg (28 Sep 2011)
- multi docs: extended the multi_socket API description

- tests/README: extended and reformatted

Yang Tse (27 Sep 2011)
- [Albert Chin brought this change]

  configure - m4: make CURL_CHECK_DEF ignore leading whitespace on symbol def
  
  When using Sun C compiler the preprocessor somehow inserts an extra space
  in front of replaced symbol, breaking CURL_CHECK_DEF macro. To workaround
  this, macro CURL_CHECK_DEF now ignores all leading whitespace in front of
  symbol substitution result.

Guenter Knauf (27 Sep 2011)
- Added SPNEGO to NetWare build.

  smtp_connect: use defined buffer length for hostname

- [Steve Holme brought this change]

  Curl_ntlm_create_type3_message: Tidied up the use of Curl_gethostname.
  
  Removed the code that striped off the domain name when Curl_gethostname
  returned the fully qualified domain name as the function has been
  updated to return the un-qualified host name.
  
  Replaced the use of HOSTNAME_MAX as the size of the buffer in the call
  to Curl_gethostname with sizeof(host) as this is safer should the buffer
  size ever be changed.

- [Steve Holme brought this change]

  HOSTNAME_MAX: Moved to curl_gethostname.h
  
  Moved HOSTNAME_MAX #define into curl_gethostname.h rather than being
  locally defined in curl_gethostname.c, curl_ntlm_msgs.c and smtp.c.

- RELEASE-NOTES: synced with d2a47021c0a6

Yang Tse (25 Sep 2011)
- Q&D fix header inclusion order

- allow write callbacks to indicate OOM to libcurl
  
  Allow (*curl_write_callback) write callbacks to return
  CURL_WRITEFUNC_OUT_OF_MEMORY to properly indicate libcurl of OOM conditions
  inside the callback itself.

Guenter Knauf (25 Sep 2011)
- Changed some main makefile targets.

Daniel Stenberg (25 Sep 2011)
- curl_multi_fdset: avoid FD_SET out of bounds
  
  If a socket is larger than FD_SETSIZE, avoid using FD_SET() on the
  platforms where this is possible.
  
  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=3413274
  Reported by: Tim Starling

Guenter Knauf (25 Sep 2011)
- Fixed MinGW examples makefile.

- NetWare makefile tweaks to select different builds.

Daniel Stenberg (25 Sep 2011)
- POST: always set postfieldsize
  
  When we use binary posts and regular ones intermixed on a single command
  line, we cannot do strlen() etc on the data to figure out the length
  (when inserting '&' and more). We must therefore keep track of the post
  data length. Then we also end up setting the libcurl option with the
  known size, so that we don't risk that libcurl will do strlen() on the
  data.
  
  This has the minor side-effect that --libcurl source codes now always
  will use CURLOPT_POSTFIELDSIZE but I don't consider that terribly
  damaging.

- test 814: smtp without --mail-from
  
  Verifies the fix from commit 322f3d5af7093

- [Gisle Vanem brought this change]

  smtp: without a MAIL_FROM, send blank MAIL FROM
  
  I think curl should ignore this case and smtp.c should test for this.
  Since RFC-2821 seems to allow a "null reverse-path". Ref.  "MAIL
  FROM:<>" in section 3.7, page 25.

- [Dave Reisner brought this change]

  lib/http: add missing whitespace in verbose output
  
  Example:
  * upload completely sent off: 35out of 35 bytes
  
  Should be:

Guenter Knauf (20 Sep 2011)
- A bunch of MinGW build tweaks.
  
  All paths to dependencies now quoted; synced examples makefile.

- Changed Windows 64bit OS define to x86_64.
  
  Also added check for __x86_64__ define since MinGW64 seems to define
  the _M_X64 macro through a header not available for config-win32.h.

- Also skip certs masked as CKT_NSS_TRUST_UNKNOWN.
  
  Fix posted by Tomas Hoger <thoger redhat com>.

- Added _WIN32_WINNT define for IPv6 builds.

- [Steve Holme brought this change]

  CURLOPT_URL: Expanded URL description
  
  Expanded the section about CURLOPT_URL to include the format of the URL
  and detailed information and examples relating to specific protocols.

- [Steve Holme brought this change]

  Curl_gethostname: return un-qualified machine name
  
  Fixed Curl_gethostname() so that it always returns the un-qualified
  machine name rather than being dependent on the socket provider.
  
  Note: The return of getenv("CURL_GETHOSTNAME") is also parsed in case
  the developer / test harness provided a fully qualified domain name as
  it's value as well.

Yang Tse (18 Sep 2011)
- curl tool: create tool_myfunc.[ch] which later on will hold my_* functions
  
  Additionally function my_useragent() now provides default User-Agent string

- curl tool: reorder free_config_fields() field handling
  
  Reorder handling of fields to match same order as the one given by current
  definition order of 'Configurable' struct fields. Fields currently not handled
  marked for further inspection.

  Additionally fix data type of result vars for iconv() calls

- main.c: convert GetStr() into a macro to ease leak debugging

- main.c: de-obfuscate a couple for-loop exit conditions

- curl tool: fix a bunch of double free's uncovered 2011-09-15
  
  Re-enabling MemoryTracking capability on 'src' subdirectory files and torture
  tests have uncovered many issues which were going unnoticed in curl tool. So
  here we go fixing some of them. Others still remain and should be addressed
  ASAP, given that curl tool is used in our test harness also for test server
  start verification purposes. There are even non-socket file descriptor leaks.

- Make Curl_safefree() macro assign NULL to given pointer when free'd

- curl MSVC project files: adjust resource compiler include path

- src/Makefile.vc6: adjust resource compiler include path

- curl tool: re-enable MemoryTracking capability on 'src' subdirectory files.
  
  Use same preprocessor logic for curl tool MemoryTracking activation in source
  files located in 'src' subdirectory as the one used for libcurl sources.

- ftp.c: add a couple of failure messages

  polarssl: build with PolarSSL-1.0.0
  
  With this fix, it should work for PolarSSL-1.0.0 (and SVN-1091 trunk)
  and retain compatibility with earlier versions. (Tested with 0.14.1)
  
  PolarSSL still doesn't play nicely with curl's CA bundle (we discussed
  this before) but I was at least able to retrieve the
  https://www.gmail.com/ login page using a modified ca-certificates.crt
  file with all 3 versions of PolarSSL.

- RELEASE-NOTES: synced with 303c90074d4c
  
  Five more bugfixes, one more contributor

- tcpnodelay: rename variable
  
  Renamed the variable from 'proto' to 'level' simply because it is not
  protocol you set but level and that is the name of the argument used in
  man pages and the POSIX documentation of the setsockopt function.

Guenter Knauf (8 Sep 2011)
- Avoid ftruncate() static define with MinGW64.

Yang Tse (8 Sep 2011)
- libssh2: use calloc as alloc function for libssh2 versions older than 1.3
  
  This workarounds old libssh2 versions not properly initializing
  some ssh session variables, which would trigger memory debuggers
  warnings on memory being used without having been initialized.

Daniel Stenberg (8 Sep 2011)
- [Adriano Meirelles brought this change]

  Curl_speedcheck: don't mistakenly clear Curl_expire()
  
  The current version of speedcheck.c may disable timeout by setting zero
  to Curl_expire. Which is fine using the curl_multi_perform, because it
  recheck all timeout internals, but when using custom event poller (like
  hiperfifo.c) it may keep stalle connection forever.

- test case 583: ensure that test failures don't go unnoticed

- test suite: libtest header inclusion cleanup
  
  Added missing memoryTracking to test cases 560 and 583. If this triggers

Dan Fandrich (2 Sep 2011)
- Fix NTLM winbind support to pass the torture tests
  
  Calling sclose() both in the child and the parent fools the
  socket leak detector into thinking it's been closed twice.
  Calling close() in the child instead overcomes this problem. It's
  not as portable as the sclose() macro, but this code is highly
  POSIX-specific, anyway.

Yang Tse (2 Sep 2011)
- MemoryTracking: fix logging of free() calls done where Curl_safefree is called
  
  Just internal stuff...
  
  Curl_safefree is now a macro defined in memdebug.h instead of a function
  prototyped in url.h and implemented in url.c, so inclusion of url.h is no
  longer required in order to simply use Curl_safefree.
  
  Provide definition of macro WHILE_FALSE in setup_once.h in order to allow
  other macros such as DEBUGF and DEBUGASSERT, and code using it, to compile
  without 'conditional expression is constant' warnings.
  
  The WHILE_FALSE stuff fixes 150+ MSVC compiler warnings.

- transfer.c: fix parentheses/braces placement for vi/emacs delimiter matching

- transfer.c: fix loadhostpairs() OOM handling

- test harness: https, ftps and ssh servers allowed start up time increased 33%

- hostip.c: return immediately from Curl_resolv_timeout() upon expired timeout.
  
  Ensure existing logic in Curl_resolv_timeout() is not subverted upon getting a
  negative timeout from resolve_server(). The timeout in resolve_server() could
  be checked to avoid calling Curl_resolv_timeout() with an expired timeout, but
  fixing this in this way allows existing logic in resolve_server() to be kept
  unchanged.

  SMTP authentication: fix ordering of preferred authentication method
  
  Fixed the order of the preferred SMTP authentication method to:
  AUTH CRAM-MD5, AUTH LOGIN then AUTH PLAIN.
  
  AUTH PLAIN should be the last as it slightly more insecure than AUTH LOGIN
  as the username and password are sent together - there is no handshaking
  between the client and server like there is with AUTH LOGIN.

- base64: fix Curl_base64_encode and Curl_base64_decode interfaces
  
  Previous interfaces for these libcurl internal functions did not allow to tell
  apart a legitimate zero size result from an error condition. These functions
  now return a CURLcode indicating function success or otherwise specific error.
  Output size is returned using a pointer argument.
  
  All usage of these two functions, and others closely related, has been adapted
  to the new interfaces. Relative error and OOM handling adapted or added where
  missing. Unit test 1302 also adapted.

  * Modification of ntlm processing state to NTLMSTATE_TYPE2 is now done

- runtests.pl: option -gw for single test windowed debugging (where possible)

- zlib: ensure user provided memory functions are used by zlib, when given
  
  As a bonus, this lets our MemoryTracking subsystem track zlib operations.
  And also fixes a shortcut some zlib 1.2.x versions took using malloc()
  instead of calloc(), which would trigger memory debuggers warnings on
  memory being used without having been initialized.

Daniel Stenberg (21 Aug 2011)
- main: fix segfault
  
  Follow-up to commit 5eb2396cd as that wasn't complete.
  
  At times HEADERFUNCTION+HEADERDATA was set only to have only HEADERDATA
  set in the subsequent loop which could cause a NULL to get sent as
  userdata to 'header_callback' which wasn't made to handle that.
  
  Now HEADERFUNCTION is explicitly set to NULL if it isn't set to the
  callback.

- test573: fix the keywords

- FTP: fix proxy connect race condition
  
  When using the multi interface, a SOCKS proxy, and a connection that
  wouldn't immediately consider itself connected (which my Linux tests do
  by default), libcurl would be tricked into doing _two_ connects to the
  SOCKS proxy when it setup the data connection and then of course the
  second attempt would fail miserably and cause error.
  
  This problem is a regression that was introduced by commit
  4a42e5cdaa344755 that was introduced in the 7.21.7 release.

  Until 2011-08-17 libcurl's Memory Tracking feature also performed
  automatic malloc and free filling operations using 0xA5 and 0x13
  values. Our own preinitialization of dynamically allocated memory
  might be useful when not using third party memory debuggers, but
  on the other hand this would fool memory debuggers into thinking
  that all dynamically allocated memory is properly initialized.
  
  As a default setting, libcurl's Memory Tracking feature no longer
  performs preinitialization of dynamically allocated memory on its
  own. If you know what you are doing, and really want to retain old
  behavior, you can achieve this compiling with preprocessor symbols
  CURL_MT_MALLOC_FILL and CURL_MT_FREE_FILL defined with appropriate
  values.

- test572: fixed
  
  Two problems were fixed:
  
  GET_PARAMETER responses that have no body must be 204 response or
  properly set length to 0.
  
  One of the <data> sections had the wrong content-length for its
  GET_PARAMETER response.
  
  Enabled test 572 again.

- Curl_pgrsStartNow: clear all flags but HIDE
  
  As bug 3385258 pointed out but I missed up the fix for. This is another
  take at a fix.

Yang Tse (14 Aug 2011)
- http NTLM: add curl_ntlm.c to Symbian's libcurl.mmp

- http NTLM: fix 8 compiler warnings
  
  Strict splitting of http_ntlm.[ch] may trigger 8 compiler warnings when
  building with some compilers and strict compiler warnings enabled, depending
  on other specific configuration options some could get triggered or not.
  
  Seven are related with 'unused function parameters' and another one with
  'var may be used before its value is set'.

- http NTLM: split http_ntlm.[ch] between http_ntlm.[ch] and curl_ntlm.[ch]
  
  For modularity purposes, huge chunks of NTLM existing code is transformed into
  functions to allow future internal code reuse.
  
  Resulting three new libcurl private functions:
  
   - Curl_ntlm_create_type1_message()
   - Curl_ntlm_create_type3_message()
   - Curl_ntlm_decode_type2_message()
  
  Changing static ntlm_sspi_cleanup() into non-static Curl_ntlm_sspi_cleanup()
  
  This 'refactoring' has been prepared by previous commits to allow that this
  specific one does not introduce any change to existing code. All existing
  goodness and badness previous to this commit should remain the same once it is
  applied, the only difference should be that existing code is moved into
  functions.
  
  Given the quite big portions of code being moved around, and the importance of
  change traceability, this commit has been done in such a way that it is
  possible to perform a three-way diff from initial http_ntlm.[ch] to resulting
  http_ntlm.[ch] and curl_ntlm.[ch] to actually verify that no functional change
  is introduced here.
  
  Notice that Steve Holme has provided several patches, but these included this
  refactoring along with 'extra' fixes. I really wanted this 'clean' refactoring
  done first, in order to allow discussion or committing of 'extra' fixes on a
  case by case basis, so, I had to bite the bullet ;-)
  
  Comments, line adjustments, compiler warning fixes, whatever, may follow
  afterwards.

- BSD-style lwIP TCP/IP stack support:
  
  Allow compilation of libcurl and curl using BSD-style lwIP on Win32.
  
  In order to compile libcurl and curl with this support it is necessary
  to edit files lib/config-win32.h and src/config-win32.h and uncomment
  a line to make definition of preprocessor symbol USE_LWIPSOCK visible.
  
  Afterwards you can compile as usual.
  
  In order to use compiled library with BSD-style lwIP TCP/IP stack in
  your program it is mandatory that you include lwIP header file <lwip/opt.h>
  before including <curl/curl.h> or <curl/multi.h>
  
  Compilation has been verified with lwIP 1.4.0 and contrib-1.4.0 from:

  progress: reset flags at transfer start
  
  When an easy handle is used to download an URI which has no
  Content-Length header (or equivalent) after downloading an URI which
  does, the value from the previous transfer is reused and returned by
  CURLINFO_CONTENT_LENGTH_DOWNLOAD. This is because the progress flags
  (used to determine whether such a header was received) are not reset
  between transfers.

Dan Fandrich (23 Jun 2011)
- Display notes from setup file in testcurl.pl
  
  Autobuild submitters can use this to add some text to their
  setup files to describe issues they've found with the build
  or tests. This could include laying blame on test failures on
  network issues or dependent libraries, explaining away compiler
  warnings or providing any additional information that could be
  useful to people reviewing and investigating problems with the
  publicly available autobuild logs.  Note that persistent test
  failures that are not issues with curl itself should normally be
  fixed by excluding them from the test run instead.
  
  This is an entirely optional field that is not entered by the
  user the first time a new build is created.

- Added a leap second test to test517

  unitteset: Curl_llist_move
  
  adding unit test for Curl_llist_move, documenting unit-tested functions
  in llist.c, changing unit-test to unittest, replacing assert calls with
  abort_unless calls

- CURLFORM_STREAM: acknowledge CURLFORM_FILENAME
  
  The CURLFORM_STREAM is documented to only insert a file name (and thus
  look like a file upload) in the part if CURLFORM_FILENAME is set, but in
  reality it always inserted a filename="" and if CURLFORM_FILENAME wasn't
  set, it would insert insert rubbish (or possibly crash).
  
  This is now fixed to work as documented, and test 554 has been extended
  to verify this.

- curl_formget: fix FILE * leak
  
  Properly deal with the fact that the last fread() call most probably is
  a short read, and when using callbacks in fact all calls can be short
  reads. No longer consider a file read done until it returns a 0 from the
  read function.

  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2011-06/0048.html

- curl_formget: treat CURLFORM_STREAM better
  
  If a piece is set to use a callback to get the data, it should not be
  treated as data. It unfortunately also requires that curl_easy_perform()
  or similar has been used as otherwise the callback function hasn't been
  figured out and curl_formget won't know how to get the content.

- curl_formget.3: CURLFORM_STREAM has its drawbacks
  
  Due to a design flaw, the CURLFORM_STREAM option doesn't really work
  with curl_formget until after curl_easy_perform (or similar).

Daniel Stenberg (6 May 2011)
- RELEASE-NOTES: synced with 32001ac4149b206

- set_userpass: convert from protocol-specific to generic
  
  The protocol handler's flags field now can set that the protocol
  requires a password, so that the set_userpass function doesn't have to
  have the specific knowledge of which protocols that do.

- RTSP: cleanups
  
  Made several functions static
  
  Made one function defined to nothing when RTSP is disabled to avoid
  the #ifdefs in code.
  
  Removed explicit rtsp.h includes

- RTSP: convert protocol-specific checks to generic
  
  Add a 'readwrite' function to the protocol handler struct and use that
  for the extra readwrite functionality RTSP needs.

- SSL: check for SSL, not specific protocols
  
  Code cleanup to check less for protocols and more for the specific
  relevant feature. Like if SSL is required.

- http_perhapsrewind: remove HTTP check
  
  No need to check for HTTP as this is now a HTTP-specific function

- http_perhapsrewind:
  
  make it static, remove Curl_ prefix

- remove FILE protocol-specific checks
  
  Also, convert the BANPROXY flag into NONETWORK for the protocols
  (file:// only atm) that don't work over networks.

- curl.1: --socks* options no longer needed
  
  As we now can specify all the socks proxy types with the regular --proxy
  option using protocol prefix.

- socks proxy: allow socks5h:// prefix too
  
  Using 'socks5h' as proxy protocol will make it a
  CURLPROXY_SOCKS5_HOSTNAME proxy which is SOCKS5 and asking the proxy to
  resolve host names. I found no "standard" protocol name for this.

- curl.1: minor edit of --ftp-ssl*

- [Jari Aalto brought this change]

  curl.1: use GNU style and sort options
  
  Follow style of GNU layout (cp, mv ...) where options are separated with

  Follow style of GNU layout by moving help related options to the end:
  --help, -M, --version

  closepolicy has been deprecated and unused for years

- ConnectionStore: remove unused return code

- curl_easy_getinfo.3: clarify some timing info

- curl_easy_setopt.3: clarify the SSH KEYFILE options usage
  
  The internal defaults are important info

- docs: mention the protocol:// support in proxy strings

- --data-ascii: add mention
  
  As it is a separate option it should have a .IP title

- url encode docs: mention '-', '.', '_' and '~'
  
  Clarify that the '-', '.', '_' or '~' letters are also not escaped since
  they shouldn't according to RFC3986 section 2.3.
  
  This is how this function has behaved since sep 2010, commit
  5df13c31735fa0.

- SSH: set non-blocking earlier
  
  Introduce an INIT state for the SSH state machine and set libssh2
  non-blocking in that so that it is set properly before
  libssh2_session_startup() is called.
  
  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/mail/archive-2011-05/0001.html

  Inspired by a patch from OB.Conseil. Added test case 708 to verify.

  CMake: improve library search, implement install.
  
  Improved library search by check_function_exists_concat() macro:

  Improved OpenSSL library search: first find zlib, then search for
  openssl libraries that may depend on zlib.
  
  For Unix: openssl libraries can now be detected in nonstandard
  locations. Supply CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH to CMake on command line.
  
  Added installation capability (very basic one yet).

- multi-socks: fix connect to proxy
  
  When connecting to a socks or similar proxy we do the proxy handshake at
  once when we know the TCP connect is completed and we only consider the
  "connection" complete after the proxy handshake. This fixes test 564
  which is now no longer considered disabled.

- checksrc: add -W to allow a file to be whitelisted
  
  Useful when a known file just doesn't comply and there's no intention to
  make it do so.

- whitespace cleanup: no space first in conditionals
  
  "if(a)" is our style, not "if( a )"

- lib/make: run checksrc.pl once for all files
  
  Since it now supports multiple files this will be faster and will show
  problems for more file than one at a time - more convenient.

- checksrc: scan many files, more checks
  
  It now scans multiple files and outputs an error+warning count summary
  at the end in case at least one was detected.
  
  -D can be used to specify in which dir the files are located
  
  The script now scans for conditions that starts with a space for
  if/while/for lines.

- Makefile: run checksrc if debug enabled
  
  And make the build fail if a warning or error was detected

- checksrc: exit error code if warnings or errors

- SSH: move knownhost logic to separate function

- source cleanup: unify look, style and indent levels

- transfer-encoding: document the options
  
  The new libcurl and command line options are now described.

- transfer-encoding: added new option and cmdline
  
  Added CURLOPT_TRANSFER_ENCODING as the option to set to request Transfer
  Encoding in HTTP requests (if built zlib enabled). I also renamed
  CURLOPT_ENCODING to CURLOPT_ACCEPT_ENCODING (while keeping the old name
  around) to reduce the confusion when we have to encoding options for
  HTTP.
  
  --tr-encoding is now the new command line option for curl to request
  this, and thus I updated the test cases accordingly.

- CURLE_BAD_CONTENT_ENCODING: now used for transfer encoding too

- TE: do the Connection: header
  
  When TE: is inserted in the request, we must add a "Connection: TE" as
  well to be HTTP 1.1 compliant. If a custom Connection: header is passed
  in, we must use that and only append TE to it. Test case 1125 verifies
  TE: + custom Connection:.

- test1124: verify gzip AND chunked transfer-encoding

- TE: rename struct field content_encoding
  
  Since this struct member is used in the code to determine what and how
  to decode automatically and since it is now also used for compressed
  Transfer-Encodings, I renamed it to the more suitable 'auto_decoding'

- HTTP: add support for gzip and deflate Transfer-Encoding
  
  Transfer-Encoding differs from Content-Encoding in a few subtle ways,
  but primarily it concerns the transfer only and not the content so when
  discovered to be compressed we know we have to uncompress it. There will
  only arrive compressed transfers in a response after we have requested
  them with the appropriate TE: header.
  
  Test case 1122 and 1123 verify.

- curl-config: fix --version
  
  curl-config --version didn't output the correct version string (bug
  introduced in commit 0355e33b5f7b234cf3), and unfortunately the test
  case 1022 that was supposed to check for this was broken.
  
  This change fixes the test to detect this problem and it fixes the
  output.

  * $(MKDIR) and $(RMDIR) have been replaced with the shell-commands 'md'

  $PATH, this confuses Borland's make and the result (the cleaning etc.) would
   not be as expected.
  
  * Removed the preprocessing step; no need for PP_CMD and the .int files.
   curl.exe builds fine w/o and the makefile gets simpler.
  
  * Added a target for creating a compressed hugehelp.c if WITH_ZLIB is  defined.
  It assumes groff, gzip and perl is available if such an "advanced"  users
  requests it. Okay? BTW. My groff and Perl needs unix-slashes ('/').
   Other perls should handle both forms ('/' and '\').

  (Yang?). But I'll leave that for now.

Daniel Stenberg (5 Apr 2011)
- return code cleanup: build, init and run-time errors
  
  Stop the abuse of CURLE_FAILED_INIT as return code for things not being
  init related by introducing two new return codes:
  
  CURLE_NOT_BUILT_IN and CURLE_UNKNOWN_OPTION
  
  CURLE_NOT_BUILT_IN replaces return code 4 that has been obsoleted for
  several years. It is used for returning error when something is
  attempted to be used but the feature/option was not enabled or
  explictitly disabled at build-time. Getting this error mostly means that
  libcurl needs to be rebuilt.
  
  CURLE_FAILED_INIT is now saved and used strictly for init
  failures. Getting this problem means something went seriously wrong,
  like a resource shortage or similar.
  
  CURLE_UNKNOWN_OPTION is the option formerly known as
  CURLE_UNKNOWN_TELNET_OPTION (and the old name is still present,
  separately defined to be removed in a very distant future). This error
  code is meant to be used to return when an option is given to libcurl
  that isn't known. This problem would mostly indicate a problem in the
  program that uses libcurl.

- FTP+proxy: macrofied functions when proxy disabled
  
  In my attempts to reduce #ifdefs in code, the SOCKS functions are now

- http-proxy: move proxy code to http_proxy.c
  
  The new http_proxy.* files now host HTTP proxy specific code (500+ lines
  moved out from http.c), and as a consequence there is a macro introduced
  for the Curl_proxyCONNECT() function so that code can use it without
  actually supporting proxy (or HTTP) in builds.

- disable cookies: remove ifdefs, move code
  
  1 - make sure to #define macros for cookie functions in the cookie
  header when cookies are disabled to avoid having to use #ifdefs in code

- fix: re-use of bound connections
  
  When asked to bind the local end of a connection when doing a request,
  the code will now disqualify other existing connections from re-use even
  if they are connected to the correct remote host.
  
  This will also affect which connections that can be used for pipelining,
  so that only connections that aren't bound or bound to the same

- rtsp: move protocol code to dedicated file
  
  The RTSP-specific function for checking for "dead" connection is better

  the function call is instead turned into a macro (in rtsp.h) when RTSP
  is disabled.

  A problem not repeatable and no proper recipe given and therefore simply
  removed for now until we hear something else:
  
  282 - 100 Continue responses should return the "final" HTTP response code:
        "Getting the HTTP response code following a 100 Continue"

- ipv6: only probe once
  
  Move ipv6-functional-probe into a single function that is used from all
  places that need to know.
  
  Make the probe function store the result in a static variable so that
  subsequent invokes just returns the previous result and won't have to
  probe again.

- retry-request: rewind if data was sent
  
  When libcurl sends a HTTP request on a re-used connection and detects it

- nss: do not ignore value of CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER
  
  When NSS-powered libcurl connected to a SSL server with
  CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER equal to zero, NSS remembered that the peer
  certificate was accepted by libcurl and did not ask the second time when
  connecting to the same server with CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER equal to one.
  
  This patch turns off the SSL session cache for the particular SSL socket
  if peer verification is disabled.  In order to avoid any performance
  impact, the peer verification is completely skipped in that case, which
  makes it even faster than before.

- ldap: use the new protocol handler setup
  
  Use the new flags field and stop using the old protocol defines.

- TODO-RELEASE: add and remove issues
  
  Removed a fixed issue, added five new existing ones and clarified one of
  the previous ones.

- protocols: use CURLPROTO_ internally
  
  The PROT_* set of internal defines for the protocols is no longer
  used. We now use the same bits internally as we have defined in the
  public header using the CURLPROTO_ prefix. This is for simplicity and
  because the PROT_* prefix was already used duplicated internally for a
  set of KRB4 values.
  
  The PROTOPT_* defines were moved up to just below the struct definition
  within which they are used.

- protocol handler: added flags field
  
  The protocol handler struct got a 'flags' field for special information
  and characteristics of the given protocol.
  
  This now enables us to move away central protocol information such as
  CLOSEACTION and DUALCHANNEL from single defines in a central place, out
  to each protocol's definition. It also made us stop abusing the protocol
  field for other info than the protocol, and we could start cleaning up
  other protocol-specific things by adding flags bits to set in the
  handler struct.
  
  The "protocol" field connectdata struct was removed as well and the code
  now refers directly to the conn->handler->protocol field instead. To
  make things work properly, the code now always store a conn->given
  pointer that points out the original handler struct so that the code can
  learn details from the original protocol even if conn->handler is
  modified along the way - for example when switching to go over a HTTP
  proxy.

  mk-ca-bundle.pl: Only download if modified
  
  Only download and convert the certdata to the ca-bundle.crt if Mozilla

  The Perl LWP module (which in a bit of a circular reference is used by
  mk-ca-bundle.pl) is now indirectly using this script. I made this small
  tweak to make it easier to automatically maintain the generated
  ca-bundle.crt file in version control.

- SSH: add protocol lock direction
  
  Some protocols have to call the underlying functions without regard to
  what exact state the socket signals. For example even if the socket says
  "readable", the send function might need to be called while uploading,
  or vice versa. This is the case for libssh2 based protocols: SCP and
  SFTP and we now introduce a define to set those protocols and we make
  the multi interface code aware of this concept.
  
  This is another fix to make test 582 run properly.

- state: add missing state to debug table
  
  As a new state recently was added to the IMAP state machine it has to be
  in the array of names as well as otherwise libcurl crashes when a debug
  version runs...

- test 582: enabled again
  
  Commit ca37692bf43b5ef should now hopefully make it run

- ssh_statemach_act: set cselect for sftp upload
  
  For uploads we want to use the _sending_ function even when the socket
  turns out readable as the underlying libssh2 sftp send function will
  deal with both accordingly. This is what the cselect_bits magic is for.
  
  Fixes test 582.

  CURL_CHECK_FUNC_RECVFROM: android/bionic fix
  
  recvfrom in bionic (the android libc) deviates from POSIX and uses a

  tests for that as well.

- test582: enabled

- PROT_CLOSEACTION: added SFTP and SCP
  
  Both SFTP and SCP are protocols that need to shut down stuff properly
  when the connection is about to get torned down. The primary effect of
  not doing this shows up as memory leaks (when using SCP or SFTP with the
  multi interface).
  
  This is one of the problems detected by test 582.

- readwrite_upload: stop upload at file size
  
  As we know how much to send, we can and should stop once we've sent that
  much data as it avoids having to rely on other mechanisms to detect the
  end.
  
  This is one of the problems detected by test 582.

- sftp upload: expire to advance state machine
  
  When using the multi_socket API to do SFTP upload, it is important that
  we set a quick expire when leaving the SSH_SFTP_UPLOAD_INIT state as
  there's nothing happening on the socket so there's no read or write to
  wait for, but the next libssh2 API function needs to be called to get
  the ball rolling.
  
  This is one of the problems detected by test 582.

  To test:
  1) git CyaSSL sources
  2) autoreconf -i
  3) ./configure --disable-static
  4) make
  5) sudo make install
  6) autoreconf -i
  7) git curl sources (and this patch)
  8) ./configure --disable-shared --with-cyassl --without-ssl --enable-debug
  9) make
  10) normal testing

  multi: close connection on timeout
  
  After a request times out, the connection wasn't properly closed and
  prevented to get re-used, so subsequent transfers could still mistakenly
  get to use the previously aborted connection.

- multi: better failed connect treatment
  
  When failing to connect the protocol during the CURLM_STATE_PROTOCONNECT
  state, Curl_done() has to be called with the premature flag set TRUE as
  for the pingpong protocols this can be important.
  
  When Curl_done() is called with premature == TRUE, it needs to call
  Curl_disconnect() with its 'dead_connection' argument set to TRUE as
  well so that any protocol handler's disconnect function won't attempt to
  use the (control) connection for anything.
  
  This problem caused the pingpong protocols to fail to disconnect when
  STARTTLS failed.

  CURLE_TLSAUTH_FAILED: removed
  
  On second thought, I think CURLE_TLSAUTH_FAILED should be eliminated. It
  was only being raised when an internal error occurred while allocating
  or setting the GnuTLS SRP client credentials struct. For TLS
  authentication failures, the general CURLE_SSL_CONNECT_ERROR seems
  appropriate; its error string already includes "passwords" as a possible
  cause. Having a separate TLS auth error code might also cause people to
  think that a TLS auth failure means the wrong username or password was
  entered, when it could also be a sign of a man-in-the-middle attack.

  runtests.pl: LD_PRELOAD mechanism will not be used to load libhostname
  library on operating systems which lack LD_PRELOAD support.

- c-ares: fix cancelled resolves
  
  When built IPv6-enabled, we could do Curl_done() with one of the two
  resolves having returned already, so when ares_cancel() is called the
  resolve callback ends up doing funny things (sometimes resulting in a
  segfault) since it would try to actually store the previous resolve even
  though we're shutting down the resolve.
  
  This bug was introduced in commit 8ab137b2bc9630ce so it hasn't been
  included in any public release.

  Typo / spelling fixes.

- [Brad Hards brought this change]

  Use angle address, as for the rest of the example.
  
  Also spelling fix for RECIPIENT #define.

- [Brad Hards brought this change]

  Add angle brackets to addresses in easy SMTP examples, as for smtp-multi example.

- cookies: tricked dotcounter fixed
  
  Providing multiple dots in a series in the domain field (domain=..com) could
  trick the cookie engine to wrongly accept the cookie believing it to be
  fine. Since the tailmatching would then match all .com sites, the cookie would
  then be sent to all of them.
  
  The code now requires at least one letter between each dot for them to be
  counted. Edited test case 61 to verify this.

- multi: connect fail => use next IP address
  
  When using the multi interface and connecting to a host name that
  resolves to multiple IP addresses, there was no logic that made it
  continue to the next IP if connecting to the first address times
  out. This is now corrected.

- smtp-multi: put recipient within <brackets>
  
  Even if libcurl might to do it for us, it is more correct.

- ossl_seed: no more RAND_screen
  
  RAND_screen() is slow, not thread-safe and not needed anymore since OpenSSL
  uses the thread-safe win32 CryptoAPI nowadays.

- multi: inhibit some verbose outputs
  
  The info about pipe status and expire cleared are clearly debug-related
  and not anything mere mortals will or should care about so they are now
  ifdef'ed DEBUGBUILD

- SMTP tests: updated MAIL FROM use
  
  They were all wrong previously since none used the <brackets> they
  should for MAIL FROM. Now libcurl adds them itself if the app doesn't so
  they end up wrong less easy.

- CURLOPT_MAIL_FROM: document the bracket situation

- [Brad Hards brought this change]

  SMTP: add brackets for MAIL FROM
  
  Similar to what is done already for RCPT TO, the code now checks for and
  adds angle brackets (<>) around the email address that is provided for
  CURLOPT_MAIL_RCPT unless the app has done so itself.

- getparameter: add error check
  
  if add2list() returns an error, bail out!

- loadhostpairs: return errorcode
  
  Make sure that Curl_cache_addr() errors are propagated to callers of
  loadhostpairs().
  
  (this loadhostpairs function caused a scan-build warning due to the
  'dns' variable getting assigned but never used)

- ftp_parselist: fix compiler warning
  
  Doing curlx_strtoofft() on the size just to figure out the end of it
  causes a compiler warning since the result wasn't used, but is also a
  bit of a waste.

  Curl_do: avoid using stale conn pointer
  
  Since the original `conn' pointer was used after the `connectdata' it
  points to has been closed/cleaned up by Curl_reconnect_request it caused
  a crash. We must make sure to use the newly created connection instead!

  ares: ask for both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
  
  Make the c-ares resolver code ask for both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses when
  IPv6 is enabled.
  
  This is a workaround for the missing ares_getaddrinfo() and is a lot
  easier to implement.
  
  Note that as long as c-ares returns IPv4 addresses when IPv6 addresses
  were requested but missing, this will cause a host's IPv4 addresses to
  occur twice in the DNS cache.

- axTLS: mention it among the other SSL libs

- 7.21.4: version bump

- axtls_connect: allow connect without peer verification
  
  The SSL_SERVER_VERIFY_LATER bit in the ssl_ctx_new() call allows the
  code to verify the peer certificate explicitly after the handshake and
  then the "data->set.ssl.verifypeer" option works.

- axTLS: allow "default" SSL version as well
  
  When no explicit version is selected we should try to use whatever is
  best for us, and in the axTLS case that means TLSv1.

- axtls.c: cleanup
  
  Removed trailing whitespace
  Removed several compiler warnings
  Removed odd backslashes at some line endings
