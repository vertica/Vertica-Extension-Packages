[[Image:Go-inkscape.png|thumb|303px|...and done using [[Inkscape]]]]Wow, I was an utter fool to ever have used paint...from now on I'll take the trouble to download gimp at school; I thought gimp was unnecessary for simple tasks of creating geometric images, but apparently I was wrong...I didn't realise there was a built-in protractor. Anyway thanks, Chuck, your explanation of the formula helped me confirm the coordinates, although paint, for vertica/y-axis parts of coordinates, &quot;up&quot; means a lesser value, and &quot;down&quot; means a higher one, so it was actually (51, 289) and (353,289)....as for &quot;ancient technology&quot;, hey this method is part of the [[Euclid]]ean era! ;-) Thanks all! I'm going to save this explanation in my notepad as a wonderful example of how trigonometry affects graphical design. :D Onwards!
